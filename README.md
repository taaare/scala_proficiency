# scala_proficiency

This is a from scratch implementation of two Scala problems I undertook to better understand the language. I had no prior experience using Scala before this. I built two files: CruisePricing.scala and PromotionCombinations.scala to test the functional and OOP aspects of the language. It utilizes first class and higher order functions, SBT, and more functional capabilities to do this. 

I also built unit tests to run from the SBT shell - though they are under development. The main functions work as intended. 

To run the main functions, use the following commands in the root dir

```console 
sbt```

```console
compile```

```console 
runMain CruisePricing```

```console
runMain PromotionCombinations```
