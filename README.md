# scala_proficiency

This is a from scratch implementation of two Scala problems I undertook to better understand Scala. I had no prior experience using the language before this. I built two files: CruisePricing.scala and PromotionCombinations.scala to test the functional and OOP aspects of the language. It utilizes higher order functions, SBT, and more to do this. 

I also built unit tests to run from the SBT shell - though they are under development. The main functions work as intended.
